GameFOX TODO List

Development issues: (let me know if you can fix this)
- GameFOX Options sometimes breaks in Mac platform
- GameFOX is not fully functional in SeaMonkey

To do:
- Linux: fix reveal css dir (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/nsILocalFile)
X Linux: Help with adding CSSes. It always says something about errors and access denied and I (abc123xyzlaw) can't add them. Do I have to manually install it or is there another way?
  > Solution: ???
- Not detected as topic list (no quickpost link, etc): topic list with zero topics
- Use nsIStyleSheetService(last) for user highlighting (so it takes precedence over the other css)
  or/and use a super descriptive css (e.g. #content > #board_wrap > .board > .message > tbody > td.author > ...).
 +Also, GamFOX should only set class(es), styles should then be handled by (internal) css.
 *If we fix it this way we would also fix these:
  - Block users only work in message list. Some css that change message's font size might break this feature.
  - unique ident(attribute) for highlighted topic rows, highlighted topic & post columns
  - HarmfulSpoon: I put someone in group 2 of post highlighting, and checked the thing to hide their posts,
    but if they post a picture, text to image shows that picture. The rest of their post is hidden, but you
    can still see their pic they posted >_<
    Can you make it so if they post a picture, it doesn't show without turning text to image off?
 *Related:
  - foxlinks || ?RegExp (more) user highlighting
- Use content policy (like AdBlock [Plus]) to disable GameFAQs' main stylesheets
- wflookup
- <<<>>> sig sep
- GFCode inclusion!
- gamefox-quickpost-afloat position (only if there's a GFCode help) :(
- Mac: GameFOX Options fix
- Detect this
    <h1>Post Error</h1></div>
    <div class="body">
    <div class="details">
    <p><b>There was an error posting your message:</b>
    To prevent flooding, no user can post more than 2 messages per minute.
    Please wait and try your post again in 60 seconds.</p>To prevent flooding,
    no user can post more than 2 messages per minute.  Please wait and try your
    post again in 60 seconds.</p>
  ! Also, quickposting a new topic with duplicate title will make you lose the post.
  ! Also, quickposting a new topic after deleting a topic will make it point to an invalid address:
    -from: http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/detail.php?board=565885&topic=36770241&message=402319652&action=delete
    -QP/preview to: http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/post.php?board=565885&topic=36770241
^-Possible fix: dynamic/raw error messages & warnings && recheck msg posting POST method
- Faster post processing (with timer), or a stop button
- Check POST sig quote etc, error message?, use /i or not?
  !annoying flaw: convert &quot; etc
- Selected text quoting
- char count
  // ALERT
  // (Check Length): The maximum allowed length is 20 characters. You have used 63 characters so far.
  // [ Check Post Length ]: The maximum allowed length is 20 characters. So far, you have used 63 characters.
  //
- auto dating (topic age count)
- Is there a way to ignore a user *entirely*?
^-Make the Filter option filter out topics from the blacklisted users
X "CSS addition not working in Kubuntu 6.10, and possibly other Linux distro's running with KDE.
   However, userContent.css is good enough for me."
- Repeat top menu to bottom page
- css (aquatakat for g10)X2
- css list box (replace the combo box)
- Derelict313, & co.: There should be a way to make different sigs for different users.
  I share a computer with my brother who also has an account here. I'd like to use GameFOX's
  sig feature, but I don't wanna overwrite his sig. This should be considered for future releases.
- auto/quick/multiple user login?
- BaalASystemLord: Is there any way to make the tag folders stay closed until they are manually
  opened and stay open until they are manually closed? If this option isn't available in the current
  version of gamefox, could someone make it for the next update?
  Whenever I delete a tag, all the folders open automatically. This happens no matter what folder I
  start in. If a topic still exists I know I could just click "untag topic". I'm talking about deleting
  the tags for topics that are gone.
  The way the folders are now makes it too easy to lose my place while sorting through a bunch of topics
  to see which tags need to be deleted and which topics I need to save to read later while off line.
  The automatic opening of these folders is getting beyond really annoying especially since I have
  no idea how to fix it on my own.

* Multiple account support
* Quickly change between them; maybe by swapping cookies
  > Great idea. I never thought it that way. Let's see whether it's applicable or not.
* Support multiple custom sigs, or different sig settings for each of them
* Possibly on the index in the "Board Information" section, add some text that lets you switch between gfaqs9/gfaqs10 with a hyperlink
X* Even more useless, grab from your user page your level and Karma; if the level is one of the normal ones (not suspended, warned, moderator, admin, etc), then state how much more Karma you need to advance to the next level (unless you're level 37)
   > no way, lol.

I had a couple more things on my mind, but I somehow forgot them.
