Releasing a new version of GameFOX
==================================

This document goes through the steps that need to be taken for a GameFOX
maintainer to release a new stable version.

Requirements
------------

* Bash
* GNU Make
* OpenSSH
* XMLStarlet (â‰¥ 1.3.1)
* Zip

Configuration
-------------

If you're hosting GameFOX on a different server, you should override/replace
the `url` and `path` variables in the makefile (either directly or by creating
the file common/Makefile.config), and the `em:updateURL` element in
install.rdf. The server will need to support HTTPS if you want to do
self-hosted automatic updates.

Otherwise, everything should already be configured to connect to the server via
SSH.

Uploading a release
-------------------

First, build release XPIs for self-hosting and Mozilla Addons:

    make release amo

Test the XPIs to make sure they're working. When everything checks out, update
the release notes on the web server. Then upload the release files:

    make upload

This automatically moves the old release into the archive folder on the server
and uploads the new XPI and update RDF files.

For Mozilla Addons, you'll need to submit the `*_amo.xpi` file manually.

What to do after a release
--------------------------

First, you should tag the git repo with the latest version number. Then you
should bump the version number in:

* Makefile
* content/NEWS
* install.rdf

Commit and push the updates above.

Consider creating a release topic on Blood Money with the title "[release]
GameFOX x.y.z", containing a download link and the release notes.

Configuring a nightly build server
