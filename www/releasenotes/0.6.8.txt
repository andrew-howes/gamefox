### About this version

This release polishes many existing features and fixes several bugs.

QuickPost's reset button has returned with an option to choose a different
signature when resetting a post. <small>(Tools → GameFOX → Main → Posting →
Choose a new signature when resetting post)</small>

QuickPost and the Post Message page now have buttons to insert HTML tags into
the post.

The Style options pane has been simplified. Imported stylesheets can be deleted
by right clicking. A new "edit" function has been added which directly opens a
stylesheet in a text editor, also accessible by right click.

GameFOX preferences can now be exported, imported and reset from the options
window. <small>(Tools → GameFOX → Manage)</small>
