### About this version

#### Tags
Tracked topics have been integrated into GameFOX and all tag-related features
have been disabled. Tagging is now deprecated and will eventually be removed.
Until then, everything can be restored from the options.

If you have any tracked topics on GameFAQs, they will be automatically imported
into GameFOX. Your tags are not converted to tracked topics, so if you want to
start tracking them you will need to do so manually.

#### Highlighting

The user group feature has been rebranded to highlighting with new
functionality. In addition to highlighting users, you can also highlight based
on what words are in the topic title or message.

#### Stylesheets

A new stylesheet, "Hide signatures," removes signatures on the message list
and shows them when hovered over.

Another new stylesheet, "Message link icons," converts the links in message
headers (detail, delete, filter, quote) to icons.

#### Miscellany

Many performance improvements have been made for GameFOX to load quicker after
opening a page.

Links to your user page and the topic and board list have been added to the
bottom of the message list above QuickPost.

Custom GameFOX window titles have been disabled since GameFAQs' window titles
now contain more information. They can be enabled again from the options.

Firefox 1.5 support has been removed due to a change that broke compatibility.
