### About this version

GameFOX can now change the date formats on GameFAQs. There are several presets
for different locales (including 24 hour time and DD/MM/YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD dates),
and a custom setting that lets you change the format to anything.

The GameFAQs clock has been improved, with support for a custom date format. It
can be enabled by checking Tools | GameFOX | Main | Page | Add clock.

Two new GameFAQs themes have been added: SpotFAQs and 8for11. You can view their
descriptions and enable them from the Style options (Tools | GameFOX | Style).

Firefox 2 compatibility has been removed. Only Firefox 3 and newer are supported.

The toolbar icons for the GameFOX options and sidebar are now different from each
other.

Favorites in the GameFOX sidebar are now in a list box instead of a drop down menu.
