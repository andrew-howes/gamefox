### About this version

This release fixes several bugs in version 0.7.8.

Problems with topic pagination, last post links, message numbering, and ad
blocking (plus other stylesheets) should be fixed. Also, the duplicate header
on the Poll of the Day is gone.

A change in 0.7.8 that made the options window block focus on Windows has been
reverted.

The QuickPost link on the topic list has been moved to prevent accidentally
clicking the Add to/Remove Favorites link.
