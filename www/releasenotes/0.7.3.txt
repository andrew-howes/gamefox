### About this version

A bug introduced in 0.7.2 that only affected Firefox 2 has been fixed. Two
other bugs have also been fixed.

Descriptions in the Style pane of the options window have been changed to
appear when a stylesheet is first enabled or from the context menu. The
"Description" column has been removed.
