### About this version

Custom quote templates were removed in favor of consistency due to widespread
abuse. The standard quote header was changed from "username | date (number)" to
"From: username | Posted: date | number".

Posts from the topic creator are now labeled with a "(tc)" next to their name.
You can change the label or disable it entirely from the options.

The active messages list now has an indicator for topics with new posts. This
is determined by comparing the "last post" and "your last post" columns. It
can be disabled from the options.

This release has focused on classic GameFAQs. Ricapar's classic CSS has been
improved considerably, and the "disable main GameFAQs stylesheets" option has
been improved so there should never be any flicker while the page is loading.
To add to the classic feel, the old style of topic icons can be emulated by
enabling the "status icons (classic)" CSS.

QuickPost now has access keys, enabling you to post messages using only the
keyboard. Shift + Alt + Z, X and C will post, preview, and spellcheck the
message respectively.
