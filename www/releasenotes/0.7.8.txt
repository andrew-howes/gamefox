### About this version

Firefox 4.0 support is new in this release. In addition, Firefox 3.0
compatibility has been dropped. Firefox 3.5 and 3.6 are still compatible.

A notification appears at the top of the page when a topic you are tracking has
unread posts. Opening the last page of the topic will mark it as read, and
clicking the "X" will mark all topics as read.

The highlighting options have an entirely new interface. The textbox is larger,
making it easier to maintain large lists. A new feature was added allowing
highlighting of all admins, mods, VIPs and tracked topics.
