### About this version

The Poll of the Day sponsorship image is now removed by GameFOX.

Firefox 4.0 support is new in this release. In addition, Firefox 3.0
compatibility has been dropped. Firefox 3.5 and 3.6 are still compatible.

A notification appears at the top of the page when a topic you are tracking has
unread posts. Opening the last page of the topic will mark it as read, and
clicking the "X" will mark all topics as read.

Highlighting now has an entirely new interface. The textbox is larger, making
it easier to maintain large lists. A new feature lets you highlight all admins,
mods, VIPs or tracked topics.

A bug affecting highlighting groups of the type "title contains" and "post
contains" has been fixed.

The GFPastel 2010 stylesheet by spynae has been updated.

The "Board Settings" tab has been removed from the options window.

Different topic pages can be loaded from the context menu of the topic itself.

(This must be enabled from Tools | GameFOX | Main | Page | Add clock.)
