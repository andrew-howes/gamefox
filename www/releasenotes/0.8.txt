### About this version

GameFOX is now fully compatible with the latest versions of both GameFAQs and
Firefox.

Several styles have been added which serve as companions to GameFAQs themes. If
you're using a custom GameFAQs theme in your account settings, you should check
the Style options to see if there's a matching companion to improve things.
