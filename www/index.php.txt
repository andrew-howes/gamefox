### Nightly snapshots ### {#nightly}

Nightly builds are snapshots of the latest development code automatically
generated at 3AM every night. They should be used to test experimental features.

Be aware that **things will probably be broken**. We ask that if you use the
nightlies to report any problems you find at
[Blood Money](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/gentopic.php?board=565885),
being as descriptive as possible. This will allow us to resolve problems quickly,
both for the next nightly builds and for future versions of GameFOX.

Nightly builds will receive automatic updates daily when a new version is built.
If nightly testing isn't for you, you can downgrade to the stable release
at the [top of the page](#download) at any time.

The latest nightly snapshot is available from [this location](/gfox/gamefox-0.6.8pre.xpi).
