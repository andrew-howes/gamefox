GameFOX adds several new features, such as quick account switching and multiple

quick post, faster quoting, very configurable highlighting, and many other
conveniences. Additionally, it provides tweaks such as a configurable date and
time format for international users.

### Nightly snapshots ### {#nightly}

Nightly snapshots are builds of the latest development code automatically
generated every night. They can be used to test experimental features.

These versions receive minimal testing, so **things will probably be broken.**
Please report any problems you find on [Blood
Money](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/565885-blood-money). It's likely that we
haven't noticed it yet!

To start using the nightlies, [install the XPI file here](/gfox/nightly/). It
is recommended that you stay up-to-date by using Firefox's add-on manager to
find updates for GameFOX. You can [revert to the stable releases](#install)
at any time.
