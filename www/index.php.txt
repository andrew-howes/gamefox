### Nightly snapshots ### {#nightly}

Nightly snapshots are builds of the latest development code automatically
generated every night. They can be used to test experimental features.

These versions receive minimal testing, so **things will probably be broken.**
Please report any problems you find on [Blood
Money](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/gentopic.php?board=565885). It's likely
that we haven't noticed it yet!

To start using the nightlies, [install the XPI file here](/gfox/nightly/). It
is recommended that you stay up-to-date by using Firefox's add-on manager to
find updates for GameFOX. You can [revert to the stable releases](#install)
at any time.
