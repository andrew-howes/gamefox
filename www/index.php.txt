### Nightly snapshots ### {#nightly}

Nightly snapshots are builds of the latest development code automatically
generated every night at 3 AM. They should be used to test experimental features.

These versions receive minimal testing, so **things will probably be broken.**
If you use the nightlies, please report any problems you find on
[Blood Money](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/gentopic.php?board=565885), which
will alert us of any problems we haven't discovered yet.

To start using the nightlies, [install the XPI file here](/gfox/nightly/). It
is recommended that you stay up-to-date by using Firefox's add-on manager to
find updates for GameFOX. You can [revert to the stable releases](#install)
at any time.
