### What it does ### {#features}

GameFOX changes the functionality of the GameFAQs boards in several ways:

* **Quick post** so you can write and post your message without leaving the
message list
* Automagic **quoting** for use with quick post
* **Topic tagging** to keep track of and to return to notable topics
* **Message numbering** so you can refer back to a specific post
* **Unlimited user highlighting groups** to notice and ignore specific users
* **Multiple signatures**, including account and board specific signatures and
an option to randomly select them
* **Account switching** from the context menu so you can easily change between
your alts
* Minor **usability enhancements**, like inline pagination on the topic list and
the ability to jump to the last page of a topic by double clicking its row

### Nightly builds ### {#nightly}

Nightly builds are snapshots of the latest development code automatically
generated at 3AM every night. They should be used to test experimental features.

Be aware that **things will undoubtedly be broken**. We ask that if you use the
nightlies to report any problems you find at [Blood Money]
(http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/gentopic.php?board=565885), being as descriptive
as possible.

The extension will automatically update every night when a new version is built.
You can downgrade to the stable release at the top of the page at any time.
