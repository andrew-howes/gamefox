Requirements
============

Packages needed to build, sign and upload (on Debian lenny):

* zip
* ruby
* libxslt-ruby
* libnss3-1d
* python-paramiko
* ... and dependencies

Spock (http://hyperstruct.net/projects/spock) must be installed in
release/spock. The McCoy profile must be in release/mccoy.default.

Configuration
=============

To upload to the server, copy common/server.conf.example to common/server.conf
and edit the file to match the correct settings.

SSH keys and local file operations are not supported yet.

Preparing for a release
=======================

Release notes need to be written. Use one of the files in www/releasenotes
as a template. The server will automatically add them to the website and
keep them updated from the git repository.

Uploading a release
===================

You must first build a distribution which contains the XPI, news and unsigned
release files. To do so, type

    make dist VERSION=x.y.z

where VERSION is the version of the release. This should be the current
version in git without the "pre". For example, you should use VERSION=0.7.5
if the git version is 0.7.5pre.

After inspecting and testing the distribution, upload it by typing

    make upload

This automatically does the following:

    1. Uploads the XPI to $(file_dir)
    2. Uploads the news to $(file_dir)/news
    3. Moves the XPI of the previous version to $(file_dir)/oldxpi
    4. Signs the update RDF file and uploads it
    5. Deletes the current nightly XPI

What to do after a release
==========================

First, you should tag the git repo with the latest version number. Then you
should bump the version number in:

    Makefile
    content/NEWS
    install.rdf
    www/index.php.txt (including date and version compatibility)

and commit+push the changes.

Make a release topic on Blood Money. The title should be "[release] GameFOX
x.y.z", and conform to this template:

    <b>Download:</b>

    http://link_to_xpi

    <b>Release notes:</b>

    [content of "about this version" section of release notes]

    <b>News:</b>

    [content of "new in this release" section of release notes (or from
    content/NEWS]

Finally, you should upload the *_amo.xpi file in the root of the git tree to
addons.mozilla.org.

Configuring a nightly build server
